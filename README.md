# Goal

The goal of this project is is to create a translation app that takes text, audio and pictures as inputs and translates it to another language of your choice.

# Splitting the work

Lets put what we will work on here:

Abishek: Text translation, Audio Translation, Image Translation

# Things that need to me done

1. Translation website home page. (Im imagining something that looks similar to the chatGPT website with a textbox in the center where users can translate stuff without logging in)
2. Login system: A way for users to login to the website so their conversations can be stored. (hint: OAuth or just follow a youtube tutorial)
3. Storage system: A system to store user information including past translations so they can bring it back up. (I recommend mongoDB but use whatever)
4. Text translation, Audio Translation, Image Translation, all the converting that goes with it ect.. (I (abishek) got this one)
